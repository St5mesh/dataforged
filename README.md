# jsonforged
JSON files of Starforged playtest rules data for use in community tools, because why should more people have to suffer through the data entry?

## Oracle Tables
Square brackets in an oracle result represent a reference to another oracle, or a special result like "roll twice".

## A Note on Markdown
I've used markdown to retain the formatting of the original rules text where possible. There's no standard markdown for underlining (which is typically reserved for links), so I've opted to use `__text__` to represent underlined text (which is what Discord uses), and `**text**` for bold text. Most MD implementations (including Github's) interpret `__text__` as bolded text, though.

Thanks to [XenotropicDev](https://github.com/XenotropicDev) for letting me use the JSON from [TheOracle](https://github.com/XenotropicDev/TheOracle) as a starting point.
