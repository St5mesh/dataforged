# jsonforged
JSON files of Starforged playtest rules for use in community tools. Thanks to Xeno for letting me use the JSON from TheOracle as a starting point.

## Oracle Tables
Square brackets in an oracle result represent a reference to another oracle, or a special result like "roll twice".

## A Note on Markdown
I've used markdown to retain the formatting of the original rules text where possible. There's no standard markdown for underlining (which is typically reserved for links), so I've opted to use `__text__` to represent underlined text (which is what Discord uses), and `**text**` for bold text. Most MD implementations (including Github's) interpret `__text__` as bolded text, though.
