# TODO
  - [x] put moves back in categories? there's a fair amount of extra category text now, so it's probably the most logical way to structure it
  - [ ] automate the versioning from the readme
  - [ ] oracle markdown adjustments:
    - [ ] more reliable links with at-the-bottom-style links?
      - hm, tricky to generate after. might have to build a hash or something to handle it, idk
    - [ ] category descriptions
    - [ ] fix missing Summary columns
    - [x] "‚èµ" should link to stuff where appropriate - programmatically
    - [ ] split table rendering for tall skinny tables
    - [ ] omit some descriptions if they're repetitive/redundant
    - [ ] integrate summaries from markdown files
  - [ ] template string for setting truths
  - [ ] gh-pages branch with simple rendering of table tree so ppl can browse it
  - [ ] propagate OracleInfo.Usage.Requires to objects in child rows

  - [x] basic markdown output for oracles
  - [x] rebuild markdown output for moves
  - [x] update content for 022322
    - [x] assets
    - [x] moves
    - [x] oracles
