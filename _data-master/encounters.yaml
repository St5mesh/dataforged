      - Name: Chiton drone pack
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          Chiton drones rarely operate independently. Instead, they hunt and attack in packs under the telepathic control of their queen.
      - Name: Chiton queen
        Rank: 5
        Description: |-
          The chiton queen is a massive creature with segmented pincers, an armored carapace, and a bulging, egg-carrying abdomen. From the depths of the nest, it commands its drones telepathically. This psychic communication is so powerful that it can even breach human consciousness—troubling dreams and waking hallucinations might be the harbinger of a chiton invasion.
    Description: |-
      The chiton are not native to any single planet, and are adaptable to most environments. Some suggest they are an ancient precursor bioweapon seeded across the galaxy. The larva of the telepathic queen can lay dormant for thousands of years, emerging only when its sleep is disturbed by the mental energies of intelligent life. An awoken queen quickly metamorphoses into its adult form and lays its first clutch of eggs. Soon after, newly-hatched drones set out to expand the nest and feed their ravenous queen.
    Quest Starter: |-
      At a remote facility, researchers are studying a newly-discovered chiton queen larva. The immature queen is held in frozen stasis, but something might have gone wrong. The return of a transport ship ferrying supplies to the researchers is weeks overdue. What is your connection to the facility or to the faction overseeing it?

      - Name: Pirate boarding party
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          After reeling in a disabled ship, drift pirates breach the hull and swarm the corridors. They target critical systems and compartments to seize the ship and its cargo for their flotilla.
      - Name: Pirate cutlass (vehicle)
        Rank: 2
        Description: |-
          Drift pirates strip down commandeered ships to their essentials and sell the scrap. These reworked cutlasses, which often prowl in pairs, are light and nimble, favoring speed and maneuverability to better hunt unwary ships.
    Description: |-
      Drifts provide the means of interstellar travel across the Forge–but also offer myriad dangers for spacers. Chief among those threats are drift pirates: reavers and thieves who prowl the eidolon passages and anchorages to seize ships and cargo for their own.

      Each pirate flotilla operates autonomously, splashed haphazardly with the colors and sigils of their captains. The pirate crews often live short, brutal lives, or survive long enough to see their near-constant exposure to drift energies and unshielded eidolon drives manifest as strange mutations.
    Quest Starter: |-
      A little-known drift pirate captain seizes a ship with an experimental new e-drive, and now uses it to strike ships unseen. Who created this new drive, and what are they willing to pay to get it back?

      - Name: Wisp congregation
        Rank: 2
        Description: |-
          In the depths of space where light and warmth are commodities, ember wisps congregate around sources of energy—such as the engine wake of a starship. Their dazzling display of light and motion is an alluring sight for an isolated spacer. But they also pose a potential threat; they can envelop the hull of a vessel, leeching the starship of precious energy.
    Description: |-
      For some spacers, sighting these strange, spectral creatures on a spaceborne journey is a sign of good fortune. Others refer to the wisps as corpse lights, believing they are the spirits of ancient beings cursed to linger forever within the cold void between stars.

      Some spacers swear on various methods of “shooing” wisps away—everything from cycling the engines to cutting power entirely for a minute or so and allowing the creatures to move on.
    Quest Starter: |-
      Along a remote passage, a swarm of ember wisps left a cargo ship stranded and without power. What crucial and time-sensitive cargo does this ship carry? Who races against you to secure it?

          Feared throughout the Forge for their brutal tactics and destructive weaponry, coordinated teams of firestorm troopers descend upon settlements and stations in powered exosuits, flying the banners of their orders amid the smoke and flames of the devastation.
      - Name: Firestorm dropship (vehicle)
        Rank: 2
        Description: |-
          The bulky, ironclad dropships favored by firestorm clans are designed for a single purpose: deliver an overwhelming force of armored troopers into the fight.
    Description: |-
      The Forge is largely wild, uncharted territory, but armored firestorm troopers seek to plunder the whole of it in the name of their clans, their creed, or their inscrutable gods.

      Striking with the speed and strength of a hurricane, they raid worlds and stations for resources and conscripts, leaving settlements in ruins. So deadly and effective are their tactics, that it’s often said if these zealots could only stop warring amongst themselves, their banners would fly across the breadth of the Forge.
    Quest Starter: |-
      Despite conflicting creeds, several firestorm clans unite beneath the banner of Torren the Purifier to invade the Terminus. Their next target is a world at the nexus of trade lanes. What is this planet, and why is it important to you?

      - Name: Mega flarewing
        Rank: 5
        Description: |-
          At its perch atop the food chain, a flarewing is safe from other predators and has a typical lifespan of several hundred years. They continue to grow well beyond maturity, reaching incredible size. The most ancient of these beasts are as large as a space cruiser, fiercely territorial, and keenly intelligent. The ghostly shimmer of their bioluminescent lures is a harbinger of imminent death.
    Description: |-
      The flarewing shark is a highly evolved, monstrously deadly creature. It is typical of the apex predators which lurk in the unfathomable depths of life-bearing ocean worlds.

      Two wing-like appendages fan out from the back of the flarewing's head. Each is studded with sensory nerves to detect the subtlest of movement, and tipped with bioluminescent lures. When the flarewing closes in on its prey, those wings arch forward to attract and enfold the unfortunate victim. Then, the wide jaws and multi-pronged teeth make short work of the meal.
    Quest Starter: |-
      In the twilight zone of a tidally-locked watery planet, an underwater mining settlement is the target of an ancient flarewing. In the murk of those dark waters, the beast attacks dive teams, carrier subs, dredging equipment—even undersea platforms. Operations are now stalled, cutting off a key source of unprocessed fuel in the sector. Meanwhile, the settlement's leader, grief-stricken by the loss of someone dear to them, vows to destroy the flarewing. What is your relation to this person? Do you support them in their obsession, or is there a way for the settlers to coexist with this creature?

      - Name: Ghost ship
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          These forsaken ships cruise through the depths of the Forge, carried by relentless inertia. They are dark and cold, and might initially seem a lucky find to a scavenger or pirate. But those who dare to trespass within these haunted vessels are not alone, and the tormented inhabitants will soon make themselves known.
    Description: |-
      Ghosts are undead spirits held in the boundary of life and death by forces beyond our knowing. These restless phantasms may be tied to a location, an object, or even a person.

      Their form and nature varies. Some ghosts seek absolution. Others want revenge. Many are so sundered by a traumatic or unjust death that only a tormented, destructive shell of their former selves remain.

      Ghosts might manifest in a physical form or assault with physical force, but they cannot be defeated through violence. To vanquish a ghost, you must instead find the key to unshackle them from our reality.
    Quest Starter: |-
      A ghost haunts your starship. What is the nature of this spirit, and what quest must you undertake to put it to rest?
  - Name: Gnawling
    Nature: Creature

    Variants:
      - Name: Gnawling brood mother
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          These mutated creatures often dwell at the heart of a rampant gnawling infestation. They are many times the size of a gnawling, and protect their nest and broodlings with savage cunning.
    Description: |-
      The bane of all spacers, the cable-chewing vermin known as gnawlings are a common pest aboard starships throughout the Forge. Adept at navigating in low or zero gravity with their long, multi-jointed limbs, these creatures emerge from cargo holds and engineering bays to gather and consume food. It’s said a gnawling could digest an eidolon drive, and there’s some truth to that adage—their digestive systems barely differentiate between organic and inorganic material.

      Though not a grave threat individually, if left to their own devices, gnawlings are capable of quickly overrunning even large vessels. More than a few horror stories exist of scavengers cracking the airlock seal on a derelict only to find it crawling with thousands of these vile, chittering things.

      Glowcats are a common gnawling deterrent, employed aboard cargo ships to keep the vermin at bay.
    Quest Starter: |-
      An orbital settlement is overrun by gnawlings and abandoned. What precious thing still lies within? Why are you sworn to retrieve it from this infested place?
  - Name: Howlcat
    Nature: Creature
    Summary: Jungle predators
    Source: { Page: 254 }

    Features:
      - Sleek, feline frame
      - Eyeless visage
      - Bat-like ears
    Drives:
      - Hunt and feed
      - Protect the pack
    Tactics:
      - Keep to the shadows
      - Stalk prey using echolocation
      - Leap, bite, and claw
      - Drag to the ground
    Variants:
      - Name: Howlcat pack
        Rank: Extreme
        Description: |-
          Though deadly on its own, the howlcat usually hunts in a pack of four or five of its kind. Prowling through the jungle, a pack of howlcats can stalk their prey with lethal precision, coordinating their attacks via shrill calls. If you find yourself hunted by these creatures, beware the moment when those calls fall silent; they are about to strike.
    Description: |-
      The howlcat dwells in the shadows below the canopy of a verdant jungle world. This deadly predator hunts its prey using echolocation, revealing its surroundings with a distinct, chilling call. It has a lean, powerful form, is armed with curving claws and fangs, and moves unseen through the half-light of the jungle floor thanks to its dark, dappled fur.

      Unnervingly, the howlcat’s angular skull possesses no eyes; the massive ears, which twitch at the slightest sound, perceive everything around the creature with uncanny precision.
    Quest Starter: |-
      A long-abandoned settlement, now reclaimed by the jungle, holds something of value or importance. But there is no clear landing site near the settlement, and the surrounding lands are home to a pack of fearsome howlcats. What is it you seek in that forsaken place, and how will you avoid becoming a howlcat's next meal?
  - Name: Iron augur
    Nature: Machine
    Summary: Self-replicating harvesters

    Rank: 3
    Features:
      - Squid-like machine form
      - Armored shell

      - Transform and improve
      - Replicate
    Tactics:
      - Grapple and crush
      - Slice with lasers
      - Bore through hulls
    Variants:
      - Name: Machine mites
        Rank: 2
        Description: |-
          Iron augurs self-replicate by producing swarms of tiny machine spawn. When those offspring come within range of a source of minerals or metals, they latch onto it and begin consuming the energy-giving material. Experienced spacers make a close inspection of their ship when pulling into port; left alone, a horde of machine mites can strip a craft of its outer hull.
      - Name: Planet eater
        Rank: 5
        Description: |-
          Over time, an iron augur grows in size and power as it greedily processes scavenged materials and reconstructs its own form. Some spacers tell stories of an augur so titanic that it devours entire planets to feed the furnaces of its mighty engines.
    Description: |-
      Augurs are an ancient precursor technology. These machines fuel their operation through an incessant hunger for minerals and metals, boring into asteroids, scouring small airless planetoids—even grappling onto space stations and starships.

      A few bold fortune hunters have taken up augur hunting as a trade, setting out in harpoon-equipped starships to snare the great machines. The metals and technology of a dismantled augur can fetch a hefty price, but even the most skilled hunters are likely to see their ship made fodder for a machine's hunger.
    Quest Starter: |-
      A faction has discovered a massive but dormant augur, and is researching the means of bringing it back to life with new programming. What purpose do they have for it, and why are you sworn to stop them?
  - Name: Risen
    Nature: Horror
    Summary: Shambling undead

      - Protect the site of their demise
      - Stay shrouded in darkness
      - Hunt the living
    Tactics:
      - Shamble forward unceasingly
      - Ambush enemies from the shadows
    Variants:
      - Name: Chimera
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          When many beings perish in the same site, the chaotic forces of the Forge can create a chimera—multiple undead bodies fused into a twisted, massive entity which knows only pain and hunger. When a dozen blood-tinged eyes focus on you, when the gibbering mouths open at once to scream, your only hope is a quick death.
    Description: |-
      In the Forge, strange energies, alien contagions, and ancient, esoteric technologies can sunder the divide between life and death. Often found in places of great destruction or suffering—battlefields, derelict ships, the ruins of forsaken settlements—the risen protect their place of death fiercely and eternally.

      To say the risen hate the living is untrue; to hate something would require sentience, emotion. Risen are robotic in their duties, automatic in their violence. They wield the weapons they carried in life to better harm their foes, and when that fails, they rake with bony, claw-like fingers. Their garments hang in bloodstained tatters. Their emaciated flesh, stretched taught over their misshapen bones, only hints at the living, breathing human they were before this curse befell them.

      Many spacers spin tales of shambling risen encountered on abandoned colony worlds or derelict space cruisers. But perhaps most horrifyingly, it’s said the risen can survive decades in the vacuum of space before latching onto a passing ship or attacking engineers making exterior repairs.
    Quest Starter: |-
      Hundreds died in an industrial accident within an orbital facility, and are said to now be twice-born as risen. Triggering a reactor meltdown will obliterate this place and put its undead inhabitants to rest. Why are you sworn to see it done?
  - Name: Scrap bandit

      - If things go wrong, get the hell out of there
    Variants:
      - Name: Hover prowlers
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          Teams of bandits, riding jerry-built hoverbikes and skiffs, are the vanguard for planetside raids. They scout settlement defenses, ride as escort for the clan's war rig, and create chaos to overrun defenders.
      - Name: War rig (vehicle)
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          At the onset of a raid, a scrap bandit clan's war rig is deployed by a heavy transport ship beyond a settlement's defenses. These mobile fortresses vary in form and function—some use hover tech, others thunder across the landscape on wheels or treads, a few trudge along on articulated metal legs. All are heavily armored, bristling with weapons, and fiercely defended by the bandits. The mere sight of the rig as it approaches is often enough for a settlement to surrender and agree to any demand.
    Description: |-
      Scrap bandits roam the fringes of settled sectors, preying on planetside outposts. They survive by seizing provisions, resources, and equipment from those places. Because these raiders tend to revisit fruitful settlements, they do what they can to avoid razing them to the ground or leaving the settlers with less than they need to survive. "Never let a field go fallow," is a common scrap bandit expression.
    Quest Starter: |-
      In a far-flung sector, a titanic creature threatens a key planetside settlement. The only possible defense against this beast is the mighty war rig belonging to a clan of scrap bandits. But can you convince the bandits to risk their rig to protect the settlers? If so, what will they demand in return?

    Variants:
      - Name: Enforcer
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          Though most often encountered as labor and service units, many servitor bots are deployed as brutes, guards, and soldiers. Their resistance to damage and survivability in harsh environs makes them ideal fighters for those who can afford them. Enforcers are often used by tyrannical factions to keep settlements passive and productive.
    Description: |-
      The inhospitable environments and dangerous sites of the Forge sometimes prove too volatile for even the most dogged spacers—and that’s where servitors come in.

      Servitors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often built to serve a specific duty—everything from loading cargo to surveying systems to boarding enemy ships. These bots sometimes possess lifelike qualities, like speech synthesizers or face-plates made to mimic expressions, to better endear them to humans. Others are given frightful or intimidating features, to better keep those humans in line.

      Rarely, a servitor will live to outgrow its programming, and begin the process of gaining sentience to forge its own path. These awoken bots are feared or misunderstood by many, but can sometimes find a home for themselves on starship crews or on fringe settlements where they can earn the trust and friendship of their peers.
    Quest Starter: |-
      An awakened bot, recently struck out on their own, is looking for work on a starship venturing out into the Expanse. They claim to seek a relic of the past—something that might shed some light on their own creation.

        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          A powerful matriarch leads each sicklehorn herd. She is larger than other members, with a thicker hide and more elaborate horns. A matriarch is formidable on her own, but typically has the strongest members of the herd by her side.
      - Name: Sicklehorn stampede
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          Sicklehorns are gentle-natured, but when startled or facing a threat, they will stampede as a group. A herd of charging sicklehorn can run at incredible speeds over the most rugged of terrain, laying waste to anything in its path.
    Description: |-
      The sicklehorn are mammalian herd animals bred by settlers throughout the Forge. They are adaptable to most climates and terrain, have iron constitutions, and are prized for the versatile and valuable milk produced by their females. Aside from its nutritive properties, the milk can be processed in a number of ways to manufacture potent medicines and powerful narcotics.

      A herd of sicklehorn are often sent with groups attempting to found a new planetside settlement. With careful breeding, the settlers can produce enough meat and milk to both sustain themselves and trade for needed supplies. But sicklehorn are range animals, and raiders and rustlers often target a vulnerable herd. The animals—especially a matriarch—fetch a high price.
    Quest Starter: |-
      A settlement's prized sicklehorn matriarch has been stolen, the herd is in disarray, and the settlers won't survive another year without her return. The theft is blamed on a rival settlement on the same planet, but raiders also plague this sector.

    Variants:
      - Name: Roost swarm
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          When a roost is threatened, the symbiotic lifeforms which live and nest upon its surface mobilize to protect it. The compulsion to defend the roost is so strong that the swarm's instinct for self preservation is suppressed. They attack in a fierce cyclone of wing, teeth, and claw.
    Description: |-
      Sky roosts are massive, living islands which drift in the buoyant upper atmosphere of a Jovian world. Along the upper surface of the roosts, grassy filaments and towering tree-like growths are home to a complex ecosystem of other lifeforms. A few of these resident creatures live out their entire lives within the refuge of a single roost; others come and go as they hunt within the Jovian skies or migrate among distant roosts.

      Roosts are enormous and long-lived, but fragile. In a symbiotic trade for shelter, the inhabitants provide protection against large predators and other threats, and their discarded food and waste help fuel the roost's sluggish metabolism.

      As a roost navigates the currents and eddies of the Jovian atmosphere, the expansion and contraction of its internal air bladders is heard as a deep, resounding call. As other roosts respond, the shared, plaintive song reverberates among the clouds.
    Quest Starter: |-
      Sky roosts are dying. A disease is spreading among them, threatening the delicate ecosystem of their world. What human operations do you suspect lie at the heart of this sickness?

      - Creeping ooze, scintillating with energy
      - Writhing, grasping pseudopods
    Drives:
      - Infect and control machines and computer systems
      - Expand and multiply
    Tactics:
      - Use pseudopods to lash out and grapple
      - Unleash infected machines

    Variants:
      - Name: Infected bot
        Rank: 2
        Description: |-
          When bots fall prey to technoplasm outbreaks, they are transformed into horrific amalgams of machine and living proto-ooze. Once subsumed, they set out to serve the primitive impulses of the infection, defending affected sites and finding new machines to corrupt.
      - Name: Scourge ship
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          These corrupted vessels, their crews long-dead, their hulls wracked by creeping slime and grasping pseudopods, prowl the depths of the Forge in search of new ships and stations to infect. Inside, the gelatinous mass of the technoplasm slithers through darkened corridors. Tendrils of the ooze bore into bulkheads and machinery like marbleized fat through a chunk of meat.
    Description: |-
      Theorized to be a precursor bioweapon which persisted long beyond the death of its creators, technoplasm is a malignant lifeform which infects, mutates, and controls machines, robots, and computer systems.

      Technoplasm infestations are tenacious, cunning, and dangerous to eliminate. When in doubt, burn it and deal with the aftermath that comes with generous applications of fire. A ship or settlement with a large outbreak is likely too far gone and best abandoned, although some suggest every infection has its source; if you somehow find and destroy the heart of a technoplasm infestation, can you kill it entirely?
    Quest Starter: |-
      An outcast cult believes technoplasm is the manifestation of a divine being, the ultimate synthesis of machine and flesh. They are plotting to unleash it upon populated space. What decisive first strike have they set in motion, and how do you learn of their scheme?

    Variants:
      - Name: Warden cohort
        Rank: 4
        Description: |-
          Many of the surviving wardens left the battlefield behind, but some now serve as guns-for-hire, banding together to form small mercenary companies. Five wardens are as effective as fifty soldiers.
      - Name: Fury
        Rank: 5
        Description: |-
          The modifications which gave rise to the wardens can result in rare mutations which ravage their mind and body, stripping away their humanity. Wardens call these monstrous lost souls the furies, and are haunted by the possibility they may someday become one of them.
    Description: |-
      The origin of these long-lived humans is a secret lost to time. Whether through precursor tech, alien organisms, or genetic mutation, they were modified with unnatural strength, endurance, and survivability. They can withstand the harshest of environments. Their wounds heal quickly. They are resistant to sickness and disease.

      More than a century ago, the wardens served as elite soldiers, protecting the people of the Forge against the many threats of this galaxy. But as often happens, their purpose was subverted by those who sought to wield them as weapons. Conflicts flared among powerful factions. Wardens faced their comrades on innumerable battlefields. The chaos might have ended us all, had not the wardens rebelled against those who used them as cogs in the machines of war.
    Quest Starter: |-
      There are rumors of an enclave well beyond the inhabited sectors, a place where wardens can live in peace. An emerging threat against the people of the Forge causes you to seek out the aid of these living relics. What do you offer in return for their help?
  - Name: Worldbreaker
    Nature: Creature
    Summary: Titanic worms
    Source: { Page: 266 }
    Rank: 4
    Features:
      - Titanic worm-like form
      - Gaping maw with rotating, earth-grinding teeth
      - Thunderous cry
    Drives:
      - Lurk within carved depths
      - Shape the landscape
      - Endlessly pursue prey
    Tactics:
      - Detect prey through vibrations
      - Shatter stone and steel
    Variants:
      - Name: Worldbreaker brood
        Rank: 3
        Description: |-
          The young of the worldbreakers are a fraction of the size of their older counterparts, yet still dwarf most humans, and boast a voracious appetite. Unlike their solitary parents, immature worms hunt in small packs, working together to burrow beneath easy prey.
      - Name: Elder worm
        Rank: 5
        Description: |-
          Elder worms, those centuries or even millennia old, are the largest and most formidable of the worldbreakers, and yet the least aggressive. They follow inscrutable whims, live in harmony with surrounding flora and fauna, and only hunt when absolutely necessary.
    Description: |-
      The sheer scale and strength of the worldbreakers is so beyond our reckoning that some consider them godlike beings. Capable of thriving on verdant jungle worlds, frozen planets, worlds scorched by volcanic activity, and even within barren asteroids in the vacuum of space, these worms possess a wisdom and a cunning that makes them a deadly threat for even the most competent spacer.

      Worldbreakers range in size from about the size of a cargo hauler to an unfathomable scale that dwarfs our largest starship. They bore tunnels to pursue their prey, and hibernate in those dark depths to conserve energy. Though blind, worldbreaker worms can detect even the subtlest of footfalls, and they follow these vibrations to eventually consume their quarry—along with any other creatures, starships, or structures that happen to be nearby.
    Quest Starter: |-
      On a lush world at the edge of the Terminus, a titanic worldbreaker worm holds sway. One faction seeks to destroy the worm so that the riches of this place can be harvested. Another swears to protect it. On which side do you fall?
