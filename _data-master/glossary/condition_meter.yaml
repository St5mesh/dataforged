    - Name: Asset condition meters
      Description: |-
        Several assets have their own condition meters.

          * Your STARSHIP and other vehicles have an **integrity meter** (seen here at the bottom of the asset card) to measure their state of repair. When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment, make the [Withstand Damage](#Withstand Damage) move. To get a vehicle back up to speed, make the [Repair](#Repair) move.
          * Companion assets have a **health meter**, which is reduced when you make the [Companion Suffers Harm](#Companion Suffers Harm) move. Their health is increased through the [Heal](#Heal) move when you treat them or obtain treatmentâ€”or using the [Repair](#Repair) move for mechanical companions.
          * Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized resource. For example, if you are a FIREBRAND, you have a fire meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies. To track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, use a paperclip or token. Or you can set a six-sided die on top of the card and rotate it to show the current value.

        You can learn more about assets starting on page XX.
