- Terms:
    - add +x
  Text: |-
    Add this number to your action die. This is in addition to other bonuses you receive, such as your stat. Your action die + your stat + adds is your final action score.

- Terms:
    - companion
  Text: |-
    A companion is an NPC asset.
- Terms:
    - companion takes a hit (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering the indicated amount of harm to your companion's health.
- Terms:
    - choose
  Text: |-
    The move will provide a list of options and the number you may select. Unless the move says otherwise, you may not select a single option more than once.
- Terms:
    - decide before rolling
  Text: |-
    Some asset abilities include a benefit at a risk that must be decided prior to rolling the dice. When activating this ability, you must commit to the choice or cost before the dice hit the table.
- Terms:
    - Endure Harm (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Endure Harm move, suffering the indicated amount of harm.
- Terms:
    - Endure Stress (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Endure Stress move, suffering the indicated amount of stress.
- Terms:
    - in control
    - in a bad spot
  Text: |-
    In a fight (using combat moves), your character is in one of two states: in control or in a bad spot. If you are in control, you can make proactive moves such as Gain Ground and Strike. When in a bad spot, your foes have the upper hand and you must make reactive moves such as React Under Fire and Clash.

    When you make a move which doesn’t define whether you are in control or in a bad spot (such as a suffer move), follow these guidelines: On a strong hit, you are in control; on a weak hit or miss, you are in a bad spot.
- Terms:
    - Lose Momentum (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Lose Momentum move, reducing your momentum meter (page 29) by the indicated amount.
- Terms:
    - make a Suffer move (-x)
  Text: |-
    Select a suffer move (page 238) appropriate to the situation, and reduce the related condition meter by the listed amount.
- Terms:
    - mark progress
  Text: |-
    When a move prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks in your progress track.

    If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability which also rewards you with progress for that action, you may mark progress again. In other words, progress stacks. Every instance of "mark progress" earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

    See page page 34 for details.
- Terms:
    - mark progress twice
  Text: |-
    If a move or asset ability prompts you to "mark progress twice," mark double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would mean marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Marking progress twice on a epic challenge would result in 2 ticks (instead of 1).

    Any additional instances of "mark progress" gained through an asset ability stack on top of this reward.

    See page 34 for details.
- Terms:
    - on a hit
    - if you score a hit
  Text: |-
    Act on these instructions if you score a weak or strong hit on a move (your action score beats one or both of the challenge dice).
- Terms:
    - on a miss
    - if you score a miss
  Text: |-
    Act on these instructions if your action score does not beat either of the challenge dice. Ties are always in the favor of the challenge dice.
- Terms:
    - on a strong hit
    - if you score a strong hit
  Text: |-
    Act on these instructions if your action score beats both challenge dice.
- Terms:
    - on a weak hit
    - if you score a weak hit
  Text: |-
    Act on these instructions if your action score beats one challenge die, but does not beat the other.
- Terms:
    - on a strong hit with a match
    - on a miss with a match
  Text: |-
    A match (page 28) occurs when you roll the same value on both challenge dice. If a move or ability prompts a specific result for a match, act on those instructions.

    If your move or ability don't provide a specific result for a match, you can still use it as a prompt to make something interesting happen.
- Terms:
    - Pay the Price
  Text: |-
    When you suffer a cost on a move, you’ll often see a prompt to Pay the Price. This move helps you resolve the outcome of that cost. If you’re playing without a guide, you make the most obvious or interesting bad outcome happen based on the current circumstances, roll on the Pay the Price table to see what happens, or Ask the Oracle. If you’re playing with a guide, they can decide what happens, ask you to roll on a table, or talk it through with you.
- Terms:
    - progress move
  Text: |-
    This is a special type of move to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track as your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

    To learn more about progress tracks and progress moves, see page 33.
- Terms:
    - reroll
  Text: |-
    After you roll your move, you may pick up and reroll the indicated dice. The move or ability will tell you which dice are eligible for the reroll; for example: "reroll your action die," or "reroll any dice." Unless stated otherwise, you may not make a reroll on a progress move.

    You may reroll only once, using a single throw for all dice you are rerolling. The new result for all dice must stand, even if it is a worse outcome than the original roll.

    Unless indicated, a reroll is never required. If you are happy with the first result, you can let it stand.
- Terms:
    - roll +[stat]
  Text: |-
    Add the value of the indicated stat to your action die. This is the basic action roll (page 26). Most moves indicate the stat you should use, such as “roll +iron." If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the most appropriate stat.

    Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to roll using the value of a condition meter instead of a stat (for example, "roll +supply").
- Terms:
    - Sacrifice Resources (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Sacrifice Resources move, suffering the indicated loss of supply.
- Terms:
    - suffer -x
  Text: |-
    Subtract this number from the indicated condition meter. For example, “Suffer -1 supply” tells you to reduce your current supply meter value by 1.
- Terms:
    - take +x
  Text: |-
    Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, “Take +2 momentum” tells you to add 2 to your current momentum meter.

    Some assets may offer additional bonuses. Unless stated otherwise, this bonus is added to anything else you gain as a result of your move. If you take +2 momentum as part of a move, and you are using an asset which gives you +1 momentum on the same move, you take a total of +3 momentum.
- Terms:
    - when you...
  Text: |-
    This is the move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation, make the move. Only you, the character, makes moves. You or the guide don’t use moves for non-player characters or creatures. If you’re just checking to see if something happens or how someone acts, you can Ask the Oracle.

    Asset abilities also use the "when you" trigger to give you additional options and bonuses when making a move. This might be a limited to a specific move ("When you Strike"), or can sometimes apply to any move that fits the scope of a situation ("When you make a move to..."). However, unless an asset specifically defines a benefit for a progress move, you may not leverage an asset ability when making one of those moves.
- Terms:
    - Withstand Damage (-x)
  Text: |-
    Make the Withstand Damage move, suffering the indicated amount of harm.
