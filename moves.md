On a **weak hit**, choose one.

  * Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.
  * You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure), and __Swear an Iron Vow__ to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and are now tormented. You may clear the debility when you complete the soul-bound quest.

On a **miss**, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.

### Overcome Destruction

When **your command vehicle is destroyed**, you must discard its asset, along with any modules and docked support vehicles.

If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a **strong hit**, you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.

On a **weak hit**, you’ll owe someone. You must mark indebted and __Swear an Iron Vow__ to complete an extreme quest in their service. You may clear the debility when you complete the duty-bound quest.

On a **miss**, as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to __Forsake Your Vow__ on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy.

If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets. Spend this experience on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles. Unused experience is discarded.

## Recover Moves

### Sojourn

When **you spend time recovering within a community**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you are welcome here. You and your allies may each choose two recover moves: __Heal__, Hearten, __Repair__, or __Resupply__. Instead of rolling on these moves, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An individual move can be taken more than once.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but time is short or resources are strained. You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with no more than three moves total among the group.

On a **miss**, choose one.

  * The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure). If you do it, or __Swear an Iron Vow__ to see it done, resolve this move as a strong hit.
  * You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. __Pay the Price__.

### Heal

When **you receive medical care or provide treatment**, envision the situation and roll. If you...

  * Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
  * Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
  * Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
  * Provide care: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care) are wounded, clear the debility and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give +3 health.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: __Lose Momentum (-2)__ or __Sacrifice Resources (-2)__.

On a **miss**, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. __Pay the Price__.

### Hearten

When **you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace**, roll +heart.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the debility and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you __Sojourn__, take +2 more.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or realization (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure).

On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. __Pay the Price__.

### Repair

When **you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical companions, or other equipment**, envision the situation and roll.

  * Making your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs: Roll +wits
  * Obtaining repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply and __Sacrifice Resources (-1)__.

**On a hit**, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the table below.

Situation     | Strong Hit | Weak Hit
--------------|------------|---------
At a facility | 5 points   | 3 points
In the field  | 4 points   | 2 points
Under fire    | 3 points   | 1 point

Additionally, you may __Sacrifice Resources (-1)__, and add 1 repair point.

If you are repairing a battered vehicle, first spend 2 repair points to clear the debility. Then, spend each point to do one of the following: take +1 integrity for a vehicle, give a mechanical companion +1 health, or restore one disabled module.

If you are repairing something other than those options, spend 5 points to bring it back to full working condition, or 3 points to repair with a complication or persistent malfunction. Unused points are discarded.

On a **miss**, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. __Pay the Price__.

### Resupply
When **you attempt to bolster your readiness**, envision the opportunity and your approach. If you...

  * Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
  * Threaten: Roll +iron
  * Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
  * Scavenge: Roll +wits

On a **strong hit**, choose one:

  * If you are unprepared, clear the debility and take +1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.
  * If you are in need of a specific item or resource which can reasonably be obtained here, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must first deal with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure).

On a **miss**, you encounter an unexpected hazard or attract unwanted attention. __Pay the Price__.

## Fate Moves

### Pay the Price

**When you suffer the outcome of a move**, choose one.

  * Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.
  * Envision two negative outcomes. Rate one as ‘likely’, and __Ask the Oracle__ using the yes/no table. On a ‘yes’, make that outcome happen. Otherwise, make it the other.
  * Roll on the following table. If you have difficulty interpreting the result to fit the current situation, roll again.

75-81  | You are harmed
82-88  | You are stressed
89-95  | You are delayed or put at a disadvantage
96-100 | Roll twice

### Ask the Oracle

**When you seek to resolve questions, discover details, reveal locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events**, you may...

  * Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
  * Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
  * Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as ‘likely’, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.
  * Spark an idea: Roll on an oracle table.

Odds           | The answer is 'yes' if you roll...
---------------|-----------------------------------
Almost Certain | 11 or greater
Likely         | 26 or greater
50/50          | 51 or greater
Unlikely       | 76 or greater
Small Chance   | 91 or greater

On a **match**, an extreme result or twist has occurred.
