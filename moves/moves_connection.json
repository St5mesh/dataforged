Give them a role and rank. Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, as above, but this connection comes with a complication or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure).\n\nOn a **miss**, you don’t make a connection and the situation worsens. __Pay the Price__."

    "Text": "***Progress Move***\n\n**When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds legacy track per the connection’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Then, choose one.\n\n  * Bolster their influence: When your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.\n  * Expand their role: Give your connection an additional role. When your connection aids you on a move closely associated with their new role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, as above, but they ask something more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the request (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure), and do it (or __Swear an Iron Vow__ to see it done).\n\nOn a **miss**, they reveal a motivation or background which puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, clear all but one progress box and raise the rank of the connection by one (if not already epic)."

    "Text": "**When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, this test has strengthened your relationship. If you share a bond, mark one tick on your bonds legacy track. Otherwise, __Develop a Relationship__.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, as above, but you must first prove your commitment. Envision what they demand of you (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure), and do it (or __Swear an Iron Vow__ to see it done). If you refuse or fail, see the miss result below.\n\nOn a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, the connection is undone. Envision how this loss impacts you and __Pay the Price__."
