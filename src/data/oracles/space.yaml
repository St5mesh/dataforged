    # Summary: Exploring Space
    The Space Sightings table on the previous page is your nexus for envisioning the vistas and encounters of your spaceborne journeys. This is particularly useful for revealing what is in range when you reach an anchorage (page 64) on an interstellar expedition. You can also use it to identify the destination or focus of a spaceborne quest.

    Since space is incomprehensibly vast and empty, don’t feel obligated to use the Space Sightings oracle for every waypoint on an interstellar journey. Instead, you may simply assume there is nothing of note and move on. Roll for a sighting only when you are inspired to inject uncertainty, danger, strangeness, or narrative potential into your story. Some of these results will be mundane, but others will lead to new wonders or hazards.

    Other oracles in this section include:

      * If you are introducing a sector of space into your story, use the Sector Name oracle (page 298) to give it a random name.
      * Use the Stellar Object oracle (page 299) to learn more about the primary star at a location. This is mostly to help you visualize your surroundings, but the strange or hazardous nature of some rare stars can incite new adventures.
      * The Spaceborne Peril and Spaceborne Opportunity oracles (pages 300-301) can help identify the nature of a deep space event. To learn more about travel and exploration within the Forge, see page 64.

        Use the Space Sightings oracle to introduce a location or encounter on a spaceborne expedition. For example, roll on this table when you [Ask the Oracle](Moves#Ask-the-Oracle) to envision the primary feature of a waypoint as you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves#Undertake-an-Expedition). Check your result by referencing the column for your current location: Terminus, Outlands, or Expanse.
