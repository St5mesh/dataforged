If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track. Momentum is ignored on this roll. On a **strong hit**, you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions. On a **weak hit**, you’ll owe someone. You must mark indebted and __Swear an Iron Vow__ to complete an extreme quest in their service. You may clear the debility when you complete the duty-bound quest. On a **miss**, as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to __Forsake Your Vow__ on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy. If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets. Spend this experience on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles. Unused experience is discarded."

An individual move can be taken more than once. On a **weak hit**, as above, but time is short or resources are strained. You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with no more than three moves total among the group. On a **miss**, choose one.   * The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you (__Ask the Oracle__ if unsure). If you do it, or __Swear an Iron Vow__ to see it done, resolve this move as a strong hit.\n  * You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. __Pay the Price__."
