# Starforged Webapp: Continued Development Plan

Current Status:
The webapp now has a fully functional Scene Log system that serves as the core gameplay loop anchor. Players can:

Frame new scenes and describe them
Execute moves (which get automatically logged)
Use oracle tools (with automatic logging)
View comprehensive activity history
Search and filter log entries
Export their game logs
The Session 0 wizard is working with all Dataforged truths, paths, assets, and validation systems functioning correctly.

Next Steps:
The foundation is now in place to implement the remaining subflows:

B. Subflow Integration (Vows, Expeditions, Combat, Connections, Recovery)
C. Legacy/Advancement System
E. Move Runner Enhancement
F. Oracle Tool Implementation
G. UI Completion
This implementation provides a solid foundation following the requirements to be "grounded in Dataforged JSON data" with a persistent scene log that captures the complete gameplay narrative. The scene log will automatically capture all future subflow implementations as they're added.
