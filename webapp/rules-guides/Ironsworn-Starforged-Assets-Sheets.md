# STARSHIP

> **[NAME]{.underline}**

\[ Your armed, multipurpose starship is suited for interstellar and
atmospheric flight. It can comfortably transport several people, has
space for cargo, and can carry and launch support vehicles. When you
[Advance]{.underline}, you may spend experience to equip this vehicle
with module assets.

\] When you [Finish an Expedition]{.underline} (dangerous or greater) in
your starship and score a hit, this journey strengthened your ties to
your ship and any fellow travelers. You and your allies may mark 1 tick
on your bonds legacy track.

\] When you [Withstand Damage]{.underline}, you may roll

+heart. If you do, [Endure Stress]{.underline} (-1) on a

![](media/image7.png){width="0.18340223097112862in"
height="0.32539260717410323in"}weak hit or miss.

> **MODULE**

# ENGINE UPGRADE

\[ Your vehicle's finely-tuned engines speed your travels. When you
[Undertake an]{.underline} [Expedition]{.underline} (+edge) and score a
strong hit, take +1 momentum; on a strong hit with a 6 on your action
die, take +2 momentum instead of +1.

\] When you [Enter the Fray]{.underline}, choose one (before rolling).

-   Maneuver: Add +1 and take +1 momentum on a strong hit.

-   Boost: Take +2 momentum on a hit.

\] When you make a desperate move to pursue a foe, escape a threat, or
get in range, you may push your engines to their limit. If you do
(decide after rolling), reroll any dice

and count a weak hit as a strong hit. Then, [Withstand
Damage]{.underline} (-2).

> **MODULE**

# EXPANDED HOLD

\[ Your vehicle carries up to 3 cargo. When you gain +supply, you may
convert it to

+cargo. When you make a move +supply, you may add +cargo. When you
[Sacrifice]{.underline} [Resources]{.underline}, you may instead suffer
-cargo for any portion of the cost.

\] When you score a miss or weak hit as you make a move to barter or
negotiate, and you have at least 1 cargo, you may sweeten the pot. If
you do, reroll all dice and add +cargo. Then, suffer -1 cargo.

\] When you make a move to outrun a threat and have at least 1 cargo,
you may first lighten your load by dropping cargo. If you do, suffer

-cargo by the amount dropped, add +that amount, and take +2 momentum on
a hit.

> **MODULE**

# GRAPPLER

\[ Your grappler can disrupt systems and snare machines and vehicles
with a magnetic

tether. When you take a minute or so to ready the grappler, roll
+integrity or +wits. On a strong hit, the grappler is charged and may be
fired. On a weak hit, charging requires extra time or focus; [Lose
Momentum]{.underline} (-1). On a miss, charging fails and you must
[Withstand]{.underline} [Damage]{.underline} (-2). If you make a move to
attack

a foe or overcome an obstacle by firing the grappler, take an automatic
strong hit.

\] If you score a strong hit when readying the grappler, you may
[Sacrifice Resources]{.underline} (-1) to overcharge the module. When
you fire an

overcharged grappler, take +2 momentum; if in a fight, also mark
progress.

\] When you [Take Decisive Action]{.underline} by firing the grappler,
you may reroll one challenge die.

> **MODULE**

# HEAVY CANNONS

\[ When you aim your cannons and use them to [Strike]{.underline},
choose one.

-   Strafe: Add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

-   Focus fire: Mark progress on a hit, but [Lose Momentum]{.underline}
    (-1).

\] Once per fight, when you [Clash]{.underline} by committing to an
all-or-nothing exchange of fire, add +1, count a weak hit as a strong
hit, and mark progress on a hit. On a miss, you must suffer a dire
outcome.

\] When you [Compel]{.underline}, [Enter the Fray]{.underline}, or
[Gain]{.underline} [Ground]{.underline} by bringing your cannons to bear
and sending a promise of violence to your foe over communication
channels, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a
match, take another +1 momentum.

> **MODULE**

# INTERNAL REFIT

\[ You have customized the cabins, common spaces, and environment of the
vehicle

to your needs. When you [Undertake an]{.underline}
[Expedition]{.underline} (dangerous or greater), reroll any dice for the
first leg of your journey. On a hit, you and your allies may envision
how you make yourself at home; if you do, take +2 momentum or +1 spirit.

\] Your vehicle is stocked with reserves. When you [Sacrifice
Resources]{.underline} and your supply is reduced to 0, first roll
+integrity instead of marking unprepared. On a strong hit, take +1
supply. Otherwise, mark unprepared.

\] When you [Enter the Fray]{.underline} to oppose an invader within
your vehicle, reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +momentum equal to
integrity. On a strong hit with a match, also mark progress.
