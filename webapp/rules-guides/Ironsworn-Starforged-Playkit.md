# BEGIN A SESSION

> When you begin a significant session or chapter of play, do all of the
> following.
>
> ✴ Identify or adjust flagged content and [Set a Flag]{.underline}.
>
> ✴ Review or recap what happened last session.
>
> ✴ Set the scene by envisioning your character's current situation and
> intent.
>
> In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight.
> This can include a scene hidden from your character's perspective. If
> you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the table
> below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as you
> return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1--10     Flashback reveals an aspect of your background or nature
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  11--20    Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place, or
            faction

  21--30    Influential character or faction is introduced or given new
            detail

  31--40    Seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected

  41--50    External factors create new danger, urgency, or importance for
            a quest

  51--60    Important character is put in danger or suffers a misadventure

  61--70    Key location is made unsafe or becomes mired in conflict

  71--80    Unexpected return of an enemy or threat

  81--90    Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view

  91--100   Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# SET A FLAG

> When you identify situations or topics you don't want to include,
> don't want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness
> when approaching, that content is now flagged.
>
> When you encounter content flagged as something to approach mindfully,
> pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you come
> across flagged content that you would rather adjust or omit, [Change
> Your Fate]{.underline}.

# CHANGE YOUR FATE

> When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a
> consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within the
> game for your comfort or enjoyment, pause and identify what needs to
> be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.
>
> ✴ Reframe: This didn't happen the way you first thought. Envision the
> moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or changes
> the content.
>
> ✴ Refocus: This is not the most important thing happening right now.
> Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
>
> ✴ Replace: This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an
> element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
>
> ✴ Redirect: Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision
> how another person or party becomes involved.
>
> ✴ Reshape: The situation changes completely. Envision what happened
> instead.

# TAKE A BREAK

> When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario, take
> a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of your
> body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel. Then,
> choose one.
>
> ✴ Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the next
> move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection and past
> experiences.
>
> ✴ Stop for now: [End a Session]{.underline}.

# END A SESSION

> When you end a significant session or chapter of play, reflect on the
> events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark
> progress.
>
> ✴ If you strengthened your ties to a connection, [Develop Your
> Relationship]{.underline}.
>
> ✴ If you moved forward on a quest, [Reach a Milestone]{.underline}.
>
> If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to
> give focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.

> complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1
> momentum.
>
> On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an
> unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. [Pay the
> Price]{.underline}.

>
> +supply.
>

**COMMON TERMS**

## "WHEN YOU..."

> This is a move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this
> situation, make the move.

## "ROLL +\[STAT/METER/OTHER\]"

> This is the basic action roll. Most action rolls are made by adding
> the value of a stat to your action die. Moves may indicate a stat you
> should use, such as "roll +iron." If it doesn't, or gives you a
> choice, use the stat that best fits the situation and your approach.
>
> Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to use a condition
> meter or other value instead of a stat.

## "ADD +X"

> Add this value to your action die. For most action rolls, your action
> die + stat
>
> \+ adds is your final action score. If you gain multiple prompts to
> "add +x" for a single action, those bonuses stack.

## "TAKE +X"

> Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, "take +2
> momentum" tells you to add 2 to your current momentum meter.
>
> Your assets may offer additional bonuses for a move. Unless stated
> otherwise, this bonus is added to anything else you gain as a result
> of the action. If you take +2 momentum as part of a move, and you are
> aided by an asset that tells you to "take +1 momentum" on the same
> move, you gain a total of +3 momentum.

## "MARK PROGRESS"

> When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the
> rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or
> ticks in your progress track.
>
> If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability
> that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark
> progress again. In other words, "mark progress" stacks. Every instance
> of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the
> appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

## "MARK PROGRESS TWICE"

> If a move or asset ability prompts you to "mark progress twice," mark
> double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For
> example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would mean
> marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Any additional instances of "mark
> progress" in the same action stack on top of this reward.

## "PROGRESS MOVE"

> This is a special type of move to resolve the outcome of a goal or
> challenge. When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled
> boxes on your progress track as your progress score. Only add fully
> filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice,
> compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or
> miss as normal.
>
> You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by
> negative momentum. In addition, assets abilities do not affect
> progress rolls unless they define a specific benefit for a progress
> move.

# SWEAR AN IRON VOW

> When you swear upon iron to complete a quest, write your vow and give
> it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection,
> add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.
>
> On a strong hit, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do
> next. Take
>
> +2 momentum.
>
> On a weak hit, you are determined but begin your quest with more
> questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to
> find a path forward.
>
> On a miss, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin
> your quest. Envision what stands in your way.

# REACH A MILESTONE

> When you make headway in your quest by doing any of the following...
>
> ✴ overcoming a critical obstacle
>
> ✴ gaining meaningful insight
>
> ✴ completing a perilous expedition
>
> ✴ acquiring a crucial item or resource
>
> ✴ earning vital support
>
> ✴ defeating a notable foe
>
> ...you may mark progress per the rank of the vow.

# FULFILL YOUR VOW

### *Progress Move*

> When you reach the end of your quest, roll the challenge dice and
> compare to your progress.
>
> On a strong hit, your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests
> legacy track

#  MAKE A CONNECTION

> When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing
> relationship (not an ally or companion), roll +heart.
>
> On a strong hit, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank.
> Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated with
> their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
>
> On a weak hit, as above, but this connection comes with a complication
> or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.
>
> On a miss, you don't make a connection and the situation worsens. [Pay
> the Price]{.underline}.

# DEVELOP YOUR RELATIONSHIP

> When you reinforce your relationship with a connection by doing any of
> the following...
>
> ✴ swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
>
> ✴ completing a quest to their benefit
>
> ✴ leveraging their help in desperate circumstances

> ✴ standing with them against hardship

> ...you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.
>
> If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark progress.
> Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your legacy:
> troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4; epic=+5. On a
> strong hit, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track. On a strong hit
> with a match, you may also envision how recent events bolstered your
> connection's standing and raise their rank by one (if not already
> epic). On a weak hit, take +2 momentum. On a miss, take no lasting
> benefit.
>
> per the vow's rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks;
> formidable=1 box;
>
> extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this vow also
> mark the reward.
>
> On a weak hit, as above, but there is more to be done or you realize
> the truth of your quest. If you [Swear an Iron Vow]{.underline} to set
> things right, take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the legacy
> reward one rank lower (none for a troublesome quest).
>
> On a miss, your vow is undone through an unexpected complication or
> realization. Envision what happens and choose one.
>
> ✴ Give up on the quest: [Forsake Your Vow]{.underline}.
>
> ✴ Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest
> value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the vow's
> rank by one (if not
>
> already epic).

# FORSAKE YOUR VOW

> When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost
> to you, clear the vow.
>
> Then, envision the impact of this failure and choose one or more as
> appropriate to the nature of the vow. Any allies who shared this vow
> may also envision a cost.
>
> ✴ You are demoralized or dispirited: [Endure Stress]{.underline}
>
> ✴ A connection loses faith: [Test Your Relationship]{.underline} when
> you next interact.
>
> ✴ You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset.
>
> ✴ Someone else pays a price: Envision how a person, being, or
> community bears the cost of the failure.

>
> ✴ Your reputation suffers: Envision how this failure marks you.

#  TEST YOUR RELATIONSHIP

> When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict,
> betrayal, or circumstance, roll +heart. If you share a bond, add +1.
>
> On a strong hit, [Develop Your Relationship]{.underline}.
>
> On a weak hit, [Develop Your Relationship]{.underline}, but also
> envision a demand or complication as a fallout of this test.
>
> On a miss, or if you have no interest in maintaining this
> relationship, choose one.
>
> ✴ Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and [Pay the
> Price]{.underline}.
>
> ✴ Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand, and
> [Swear]{.underline} [an Iron Vow]{.underline} (formidable or greater)
> to see it done. Until you complete the
>
> quest, take no benefit for the connection. If you refuse or fail, the
> connection is permanently undone

# FORGE A BOND

### *Progress Move*

> When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve, roll the
> challenge dice and compare to your progress.
>
> On a strong hit, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your bonds
> legacy track per the connection's rank: troublesome=1 tick;
> dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes.
> Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then,
> choose one.
>
> ✴ Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely
> associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
>
> ✴ Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid you
> on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and take +1
> momentum on a hit.
>
> On a weak hit, as above, but they ask something more of you first. To
> gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the
> request, and do it (or [Swear an]{.underline} [Iron Vow]{.underline}
> to see it done).
>
> On a miss, they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at
> odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice,
> take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then,

# UNDERTAKE AN EXPEDITION

> When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over
