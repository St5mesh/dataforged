> **RULES SUMMARY**

# MOVES

> Moves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or
> question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations
> you encounter in *Starforged*. Moves are centered on the players and
> your protagonists. Other characters do not make moves.
>
> When you do something or encounter a situation within the scope of a
> move, refer to the move and follow its instructions. When a move's
> name is referenced by another move, you'll see it as
> [underlined]{.underline} text.

## GROUP MOVES

> When you are adventuring with allies--- protagonists portrayed by
> other players--- one of you often make moves to resolve a challenge
> for the group. This represents that character taking the lead in a
> particular scene.
>
> Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any
> mechanical bonus you gain from a move is applied only to the character
> making the move. Everyone else benefits from the narrative success.
>
> When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you
> should apply mechanical and narrative costs to an individual or the
> group in a way that best fits the current situation.

#  THE ACTION ROLL

> Roll your action die (d6) and two challenge dice (2d10).
>
> Then, add a stat to your action die. The move will tell you what stat
> to add (phrased as "roll
>
> +stat"), or may give you a choice. Some moves will tell you to use a
> condition meters, such as health or supply, in place of a stat. You
> may also have an opportunity to apply one or more
>
> bonuses called adds (phrased as "add +X").
>
> The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action
> score. Your action score is never greater than 10.
>
> To determine the outcome of your move, check if the action score beats
> the individual values of the challenge dice.
>

## ACTION ROLL OUTCOMES

> There are three possible outcomes for the action roll.

> height="0.11279090113735783in"}![](media/image4.png){width="0.15002734033245843in"
> height="0.11279090113735783in"}Strong Hit: Your action score beats the
> value of both challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to
> do.
>
> ![](media/image4.png){width="0.15002734033245843in"

> height="0.12311023622047244in"}Weak Hit: Your action score beats only
> one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser
> effect.
>
> ![](media/image6.png){width="0.1230971128608924in"
> height="0.12311023622047244in"}![](media/image6.png){width="0.1230971128608924in"
> height="0.12311023622047244in"}Miss: Your action score doesn't beat
> either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions.

# MATCHES

> When you make an action roll, check the value
>
> of your challenge dice. If they are the same, you've rolled a match.
>
> Some moves and assets offer specific outcomes on a match. Otherwise,
> you can use a match as a prompt to add a twist, create a new
> complication, or introduce a new peril.
>
> You can let the outcome of an action influence the nature of a match.
>
> ![](media/image9.png){width="0.15002734033245843in"
> height="0.11279090113735783in"}![](media/image9.png){width="0.15002734033245843in"
> height="0.11279090113735783in"}Strong hit: The match represents an
> interesting twist or new opportunity.
>
> ![](media/image6.png){width="0.1230971128608924in"
> height="0.12311023622047244in"}![](media/image6.png){width="0.1230971128608924in"
> height="0.12311023622047244in"}Miss: The match represents a heightened
> negative outcome, a complication, or new danger.
>
> You can also let the intensity of the success or failure frame how you
> interpret a match. Rolling matched 10's on your challenge dice should
> prompt you to introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure.

#  MOMENTUM

> Your momentum meter ranges from -6 to
>
> +10 and represents your inertia, luck, and confidence. It is located
> on the left side of your character sheet. Move results and asset
> abilities may prompt you to increase or decrease momentum.

## ![](media/image10.png){width="0.247415791776028in" height="0.26630468066491686in"}![](media/image11.png){width="0.24749890638670166in" height="0.26633311461067366in"}![](media/image10.png){width="0.247415791776028in" height="0.26630468066491686in"}![](media/image11.png){width="0.24749890638670166in" height="0.26633311461067366in"}GAINING MOMENTUM

> You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. If a
> move tells you to add momentum---phrased as "take
>
> +X momentum"---increase your momentum meter by that amount.

## LOSING MOMENTUM

> When you suffer a cost that causes a delay or puts you at a
> disadvantage, make the [Lose Momentum]{.underline} move. Using this
> move, as appropriate to the severity of the situation, reduce your
> momentum by -1, -2, or -3.
>
> Some moves or assets will prompt you to [Lose]{.underline}
> [Momentum]{.underline} as part of an outcome for an action, and may
> specify an amount of momentum to suffer, phrased as "[Lose
> Momentum]{.underline} (-X)."

## BURNING MOMENTUM

> Burning momentum is a powerful option to deliver a decisive result or
> avoid dire failure. When you have positive momentum, after you make an
> action roll, you may replace your action score with your current
> momentum value to improve your result.

## RESETTING MOMENTUM

> After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum by immediately
> adjusting your momentum meter to your momentum reset value.
>
> The default reset is +2. This value is reduced when you suffer from an
> impact.
>
> ✴ If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1.
>
> ✴ If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.

# PROGRESS TRACKS

> A progress track measures your headway against a goal or obstacle,
> including quests, expeditions, connections, and fights.
>
> Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes that you fill in---or
> mark---as you advance toward your goal. When you create a progress
> track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing order of severity, the
> ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic.

## MARKING PROGRESS

> When a move tells you to mark progress, fill in the appropriate number
> of ticks or progress boxes per the rank of your challenge.
>
> If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability
> that also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark
> progress again. In other words, "mark progress" stacks. Every instance
> of progress earned within the same action allows you to mark the
> appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

##  SHARED PROGRESS TRACKS

> When you and your allies are working together to resolve a
> challenge---a quest, expedition, connection, or fight---you share a
> progress track. This is called a shared challenge. When a move prompts
> someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked on your
> shared progress track.

# PROGRESS MOVES

> There are several key moves, called progress moves, which utilize
> progress tracks to resolve the outcome of challenges.

## MAKING A PROGRESS ROLL

> You don't make an action roll when making a progress move. Instead,
> tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four
> ticks). This is your progress score. Then, roll only the challenge
> dice and compare your progress score to the value of the dice.

# LEGACY TRACKS

> As you complete quests, form bonds, and make discoveries, you advance
> along your legacy tracks.

## MARKING LEGACY REWARDS

> ![](media/image18.png){width="0.25949912510936135in"
> height="0.14108267716535433in"}![](media/image19.png){width="0.26054133858267714in"
> height="0.14212489063867018in"}In recognition of notable achievements,
> moves and assets will prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes on one or
> more legacy tracks.
>
> Legacy tracks do not have a rank, but are otherwise treated the same
> as a standard progress track. It takes four ticks to fill a box.

## GAINING EXPERIENCE

> ![](media/image18.png){width="0.25949912510936135in"
> height="0.14108267716535433in"}![](media/image19.png){width="0.26054133858267714in"
> height="0.14212489063867018in"}When you fill a legacy track box with
> four ticks, make the [Earn Experience]{.underline} move. Per that
> move, take 2 experience for each newly filled legacy box.
>
> The two experience counters attached to a full legacy track box each
> represent 1 earned experience that is ready to spend.

## SPENDING EXPERIENCE

> ![](media/image20.png){width="0.25949912510936135in"
> height="0.14108267716535433in"}![](media/image21.png){width="0.26054133858267714in"
> height="0.14212489063867018in"}You spend earned experience to gain or
> upgrade assets. Per the [Advance]{.underline} move, it costs 2
> experience to upgrade
>
> an existing asset, and 3 experience to buy a new asset. Once you spend
> experience, fill in the experience counters.

## ROLLING ON A LEGACY TRACK

> If a move prompts you to make a test against a legacy track, treat it
> as a standard progress roll. Tally the number of filled boxes on the
> track for your progress score. As with a progress roll, momentum is
> ignored.

##  CLEARING A LEGACY TRACK

> When you fill all ten boxes on a legacy track, erase all boxes and
> experience counters, and resume marking legacy rewards in the now-
> empty track.
>
> When you clear the track, mark the "10" bubble in the top right
> corner. This is your reminder to treat the value of the track as 10 if
> you make a progress roll against it.

## EARNING EXPERIENCE ON A COMPLETED TRACK

> Because a completed legacy track represents a character nearing the
> height of their potential, you gain experience at a slower rate on
> that track. Take 1 experience for each filled legacy track box instead
> of 2.

# CONDITION METERS

> Along the right side of your character sheet are three condition
> meters: health, spirit, and supply. Their values are reduced when you
> face hardship through a suffer move, and increased when you make
> recover moves.
>
> ✴ Health represents your physical condition and stamina.
>
> ✴ Spirit is your morale and mental state.
>
> ✴ Supply is an abstract representation of your overall preparedness,
> including food,
>
> water, fuel, weapons, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general
> upkeep.

## ALLIES AND SUPPLY

> If you are playing with allies, you share the same supply value. If
> any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer the result of an
> outcome that forces you to [Sacrifice]{.underline}
> [Resources]{.underline}, each of you adjust your supply meter
> accordingly.

## ASSET CONDITION METERS

> Some assets have their own condition meters, such as a vehicle's
> integrity meter or a companion's health meter. Track their status
> using the condition meter on the asset card.

# IMPACTS

> Impacts represent temporary, long-term, and permanent disadvantages.
> Moves will tell you when to mark an impact, or may give you an option
> to mark an impact to avoid a greater danger.
>
> Impacts reduce your max momentum. Each marked impact reduces your max
> momentum (normally 10) by 1.
>
> Impacts also reduce your momentum reset:
>
> ✴ If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead of
> +2).
>
> ✴ If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0
> (instead of +2).

## MISFORTUNES

> ✴ Wounded may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to [Endure
> Harm]{.underline}. You
>
> are severely injured.
>
> ✴ Shaken may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to [Endure
> Stress]{.underline}. You are
>
> despairing or distraught.
>
> ✴ Unprepared is marked when you [Sacrifice Resources]{.underline} and
> are reduced to
>
> 0 supply. You are not properly equipped for the dangers of the Forge.
> Because you and your allies share the same supply value, you mark
> unprepared together.

## VEHICLE TROUBLES

> ✴ Battered may be marked when your vehicle is at 0 integrity and you
> fail to
>
> [Withstand Damage]{.underline}. It's barely holding together. Until
> you successfully [Repair]{.underline}, you cannot raise the vehicle's
> integrity.
>
> ✴ Cursed may be marked when your command vehicle is at 0 integrity and
>
> you fail to [Withstand Damage]{.underline}. This is a permanent
> impact. Your ship will never be quite right again.

## BURDENS

> ✴ Doomed is marked when you [Face Death]{.underline} and return from
> death's door with a soul-
>
> bound quest.
>
> ✴ Tormented is marked when you [Face]{.underline}
> [Desolation]{.underline}, gain visions of a distressing
>
> future, and undertake a quest to prevent that dire fate.
>
> ✴ Indebted is marked when you [Overcome]{.underline}
> [Destruction]{.underline}. To replace what was lost and
>
> repay the debt, you will take on a duty- bound quest.

## LASTING EFFECTS

> ✴ Permanently harmed may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail
> to [Endure]{.underline}
>
> [Harm]{.underline}. You have suffered a wound that you must reckon
> with, such as the loss of an eye or hand. Or you bear physical scars
> that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident.
>
> ✴ Traumatized may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to
> [Endure Stress]{.underline}**.**
>
> Your experiences have left you emotionally or mentally scarred.

# ASSETS

> Assets represent your background, skills, traits, companions, and
> resources. They have abilities that give you additional options and
> bonuses when making a move---or sometimes act as their own
> self-contained moves.
>
> When you create your character, you pick three assets. You also start
> your campaign with a STARSHIP command vehicle.
>
> As you mark progress on your legacy tracks, you [Earn
> Experience]{.underline}. This experience is spent to purchase or
> upgrade assets through the [Advance]{.underline} move.

## BUYING AN ASSET

> Buying a new asset costs 3 experience. All assets include three
> abilities. The first ability is enabled when you purchase the asset.

## UPGRADING AN ASSET

> It costs 2 experience to claim the second or third ability for an
> existing asset. When you spend experience to upgrade an asset, fill in
> the dot on the asset card to show you've acquired the ability. The
> second and third abilities may be selected in any order.

# ORACLES

> Make the [Ask the Oracle]{.underline} move to help guide your
> campaign. The most basic function of this move is to answer a yes/no
> question, but you can also use the *Starforged* oracle tables to
> generate story events, locations, characters, creatures, and more.
>
> Whenever you are prompted to generate a result between 1 and 100, roll
> two ten-sided dice. Decide before rolling which represents the tens
> digit and which is the units. This is an oracle roll.

#  EQUIPMENT

> Your supply meter is an abstract representation of your overall
> readiness. You are otherwise armed, armored, and equipped as
> appropriate to your vision of your character.
>
> Make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like. Envision
> how it enables you to make moves where that gear is important, or
> perhaps allows you to avoid the risky nature of a move altogether.
>
> If you ever need to know if you have a specific helpful item, make the
> [Check Your Gear]{.underline} move.

# VEHICLES

> There are three categories of vehicles.

## COMMAND VEHICLE

> Your command vehicle is your STARSHIP asset, earned at character
> creation. If you are playing with others, you and your allies share
> this asset.
>
> The STARSHIP command vehicle has an integrity meter, and can suffer
> from battered or cursed impacts.

## SUPPORT VEHICLES

> Support vehicles are assets that represent special secondary vehicles.
> They can be carried and launched by your STARSHIP. They have an
> integrity meter, and can suffer from the battered impact.

## INCIDENTAL VEHICLES

> An incidental vehicle is one you temporarily acquire through the
> course of your story. Incidental vehicles have an integrity meter, but
> cannot be marked as battered. When you board an incidental vehicle,
> envision its nature and assign a max integrity as follows.
>
> ✴ Heavy incidental vehicle: 4 integrity
>
> ✴ Medium incidental vehicle: 3 integrity
>
> ✴ Light incidental vehicle: 2 integrity
