##  KEEP IT MOVING

> When looking at the options in a category, read the bolded text as a
> quick summary of your choices. The details and quest starters are
> there for further inspiration after you make a pick.
>
> If a particular category isn't relevant to your evolving setting, or
> doesn't interest you right now, ignore it and move on. You can come
> back to this exercise later to make a decision for a truth when you
> encounter that aspect in play.

## CONDUCTING THE EXERCISE AS A GROUP ACTIVITY

> If you're playing *Starforged* with others, give everyone at the table
> an opportunity to influence each choice.
>
> If you want to structure the exercise, choose a player to serve as the
> mediator for each category. As mediator, you read the truths, guide
> the discussion, and make a final decision. Then the player on your
> left acts as the mediator for the next category. And so on.

## LEAVING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

> Create the broad outlines for your campaign, while leaving room for
> inspiration and surprises.
>
> Space is provided in this workbook for notes and custom truths, but
> keep it simple. Don't get mired in details. You can save these
> worksheets and expand on your notes in play.

## RESOLVING CONTRADICTIONS

> If you encounter contradictions from one category to another, feel
> free to bend the truths to better fit your emerging setting. But
> seeming contradictions can be the foundation of great stories. You may
> even discover through play that a choice you make here---which
> reflects common knowledge---isn't the actual truth after all.

## STARTING TO ENVISION YOUR CHARACTER

> Each category offers prompts to consider your character's background
> and perspective, marked with this icon: \^. Take a moment to consider
> any aspects interesting to you, and gloss over those you prefer to
> ignore or discover in play.
>
> Recommended assets for your character are shown with the asset title
> in ALL CAPS. If a suggested asset interests you, set that asset card
> aside or make a note. You'll pick your assets when you create your
> character.
